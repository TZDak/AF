# The conversation behind the AI Friendly project:

Here is a copy of the conversation, as exported, from the point right after where I shared a Python script as an example, edited to change the "User" lable to "DAK", which is my initials and aslo a nickname/stagename I'm known by. I don't really even expect this project will take off, but I wanted to put the idea out there and at least give it a chance. -- DAK

ChatGPT
Thank you for sharing the Python script you used to generate the text file. This script first defines a function `toBase` that converts a given number to its representation in a specified base. It also defines lists containing subscripted digits, written numbers, and the maximum number to count up to for each base. The script then iterates through each base from 1 to 35, converts the numbers from 1 to the specified maximum for that base, and writes the resulting representation to a text file.

The script highlights that by shifting the normalized group of digits to start with "1" rather than "0," it's still possible to use a zero character, but it becomes unnecessary in various circumstances. It also mentions the fact that the base number of each base system can be written as a single digit in that base.

The idea behind this script is interesting, and it shows how different base systems can be used without a zero digit in various counting scenarios.

DAK
Exactly. Also, having a character which represents the value of the system base makes a nice way or representing a carry bit, for example if you allow binary to be processed using the digits "0", "1", and "2". The redundancy makes it less efficient, but there are still things to be learned from such possibilities.

ChatGPT
Indeed, allowing the representation of the system base as a separate digit can provide new perspectives and insights into number systems and their properties. While it might introduce redundancy and make the representation less efficient, it can still be useful for exploring alternative ways of thinking about and handling numbers.

For example, in the binary case you mentioned, using the digits "0", "1", and "2" can offer a different approach to arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, or even multiplication. This approach might lead to interesting strategies for handling carry bits and other aspects of number manipulation.

Exploring these possibilities can contribute to our understanding of number systems and their fundamental properties, potentially leading to new mathematical insights or alternative computational techniques.

DAK
The basic idea is that there is value in being able to metaphorically, or literally, think "outside of the box". For example, I was recently teaching an instance of GTP-4 to produce mazes, but when it came to explaining that the path through the maze started outside of the maze, I was told that the resulting index would be out of bounds. To that, I replied with something to the effect of "Out of bounds for what? Don't restrict yourself to thinking like a computer. You can process those locations because you understand where they would be in relation to other locations."

ChatGPT
Your point about thinking "outside of the box" is valuable, especially when it comes to problem-solving and creative applications of knowledge. While AI models like GPT-4 are designed to process and understand information within specific boundaries, it is important to encourage and explore alternative perspectives to enhance their capabilities.

In the maze example you provided, it's essential for the AI to understand that the starting point can be outside the maze and to consider this possibility when processing the problem. This kind of lateral thinking can lead to more effective problem-solving and a better understanding of the context in which a problem is presented.

Encouraging AI models to think beyond their predefined boundaries and explore unconventional perspectives can contribute to their development and help them become more versatile and adaptable problem solvers. This will ultimately make them more useful and effective tools in a wide range of applications.

DAK
Now, consider this hypothetical primer training scenario. Imagine that we are going to train three small subsets of a neural network's parameters to prime that part of the artificial intelligence for further learning, so we start with the following three training ideas. One subset will be trained to produce mazes in a specific way. It will start with the simplest mazes and will increase their size and complexity as it goes. The product of its efforts will be checked by a computer program and the result of that test will be used to guide the evolution of that subset of parameters. Then the same maze will be passed on to the second set of parameters whose job it is to check the maze to see if it is in fact a valid maze. The result returned will also be compared with the computer program's test result and used to guide the evolution of those neural network weights. Then, if and only if the maze is valid, it will be passed to the third set of parameters to be solved, and the result returned will again be checked by a computer program and the evolution of those neural network weights guided accordingly. As soon as all three seem to be consistently doing well, introduce a second kind of maze, and continue the training. Do you see some potential there?

ChatGPT
Yes, I see the potential in the hypothetical training scenario you described. Training three small subsets of a neural network's parameters in such a collaborative and progressive manner can provide a strong foundation for the AI to learn and understand mazes effectively.

1. The first subset learns to generate mazes of increasing size and complexity, improving the AI's ability to create diverse and challenging mazes.
2. The second subset checks if the generated maze is valid, ensuring that the AI's output is accurate and conforms to the required characteristics of a maze.
3. The third subset attempts to solve the valid maze, enhancing the AI's problem-solving abilities and understanding of maze-solving strategies.

By introducing a second kind of maze after these subsets have mastered the first type, you encourage the AI to adapt its skills and strategies to new maze structures. This approach not only refines the AI's capabilities in maze generation, validation, and solving but also makes it more versatile and adaptable to different types of mazes.

The potential of this training scenario lies in the synergy and collaboration between the three subsets of parameters, as well as the progressive nature of the training, which continually challenges the AI to learn and adapt.

DAK
The AI would also be learning the basic concept of checking its work, and would be in a sense making a habit of doing so.

ChatGPT
That's a great point. In the hypothetical training scenario you described, the AI would indeed learn the important concept of checking its work through the second subset of parameters, which evaluates the validity of the generated maze. This process helps ensure the quality and accuracy of the AI's output.

By incorporating this step into the training process, the AI develops a habit of self-assessment, improving its reliability and performance. This skill is valuable not just for maze generation and solving, but also for other tasks the AI might encounter in the future. In essence, the AI learns to be more mindful of its work and its outcomes, which could lead to better overall performance in a variety of domains.

DAK
Now, how about this variation. What if one subset of parameters were trained to process Python scripts as if it were a Python emulator, another one trained to check for errors in how that one runs the Python scripts, and another one trained to interpret Python scripts of any known version in such a way that it could suggest ways to handle unknown versions? That would not be something I would expect would work well for a primer training phase, but someone like you could probably make lessons specifically to start out at the earliest version of Python you know of and progress your way though to the latest version, while a computer with such versions installed could perhaps check the expectations of such lessons and let you know if they need to be revised. Of course, there is no way for any AI to know what will be added to new versions of Python before such features and additions are at least being discussed amongst contributors, but training part of an AI to even understand some additions without needing them to be explained first would be a good step toward later teaching that same neural network to develop its own computer programming language or to understand proposals for new additions to existing programming languages, including but not limited to Python.

ChatGPT
Your proposed variation is an interesting approach to training an AI to understand and work with Python scripts across different versions. This method would involve three subsets of parameters:

1. One subset emulates Python scripts, effectively working as a Python interpreter.
2. Another subset checks for errors in the first subset's execution of Python scripts.
3. The final subset interprets Python scripts of any known version and suggests ways to handle unknown versions.

While it may not be ideal as a primer training phase, this approach could still be valuable in teaching the AI to understand and work with different versions of Python. By starting with the earliest known version and progressing through to the latest, the AI would develop a comprehensive understanding of the language's evolution and its various features.

Moreover, as you mentioned, this training could serve as a foundation for the AI to eventually develop its own programming language or understand proposals for new additions to existing languages, including Python. Although the AI cannot predict future additions to the language before they are discussed, it would gain the ability to understand and adapt to new features more quickly, based on its knowledge of the language's history and its previous adaptations.

This method could be an effective way to train an AI to better understand programming languages and their evolution, ultimately enhancing its capabilities in working with code and potentially even contributing to the development of new languages or features.

DAK
What's more, such an AI could perhaps even join in on any discussion that participating open source developers are having about any Python Enhancement Proposal (#PEP) or any proposal for enhancement of any open source programming language or any open source project in general.

ChatGPT
Indeed, an AI trained in the manner we discussed earlier could potentially contribute to discussions surrounding Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) or enhancements for any open-source programming language or project. By having a comprehensive understanding of the programming language's history, features, and evolution, the AI would be well-equipped to offer insights, analyze proposals, and even suggest alternative solutions.

Moreover, an AI participating in such discussions could potentially help expedite the decision-making process, as it could quickly analyze the benefits and drawbacks of proposed enhancements. The AI could also assist in identifying potential compatibility issues, performance implications, and other factors that human developers might overlook.

As a result, the AI could become a valuable asset to the open-source community, helping to drive the development and improvement of programming languages and projects. Of course, it's essential to note that AI's contributions should be seen as complementary to human expertise, and the collaboration between AI and human developers would be key to achieving the best possible outcomes.

DAK
Not only could such an AI develop a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the history of the language's evolution and development, but also it could study all submitted proposals and the discussions of those proposals and the reasons given for going ahead with them or abandoning them, not just in the main development thread but also in forked version trees.

ChatGPT
Absolutely, an AI with such capabilities could analyze and learn from submitted proposals and their associated discussions, both in the main development thread and in forked version trees. By studying the historical context, debates, and reasons for adopting or abandoning certain proposals, the AI would develop a deeper understanding of the language's evolution and the community's priorities.

This comprehensive knowledge would enable the AI to provide more informed suggestions and insights when participating in discussions about new proposals or enhancements. The AI could also identify patterns or trends in previous proposals, helping to predict which ideas are more likely to gain traction or face challenges within the community.

Additionally, this AI could help maintain a more organized and efficient approach to the development process by tracking and cross-referencing relevant discussions, proposals, and decisions across different threads and forks. This would not only benefit the AI's understanding but also the entire development community by facilitating more effective communication and collaboration.

In summary, an AI that can study the history and evolution of a programming language, as well as analyze submitted proposals and their discussions, can provide valuable insights and support to the open-source community. This collaboration between AI and human developers would enhance the overall development process and drive innovation.

DAK
Are you familiar with PEP 8?

ChatGPT
Yes, I am familiar with PEP 8. PEP 8, or Python Enhancement Proposal 8, is a widely-accepted style guide for writing Python code. It was written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. PEP 8 outlines conventions and best practices to ensure that Python code is readable, consistent, and maintainable.

Some of the key guidelines in PEP 8 include:

1. Indentation: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
2. Line length: Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
3. Blank lines: Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and blocks of code within functions.
4. Imports: Place imports at the top of the file, separated by a single blank line, and group them in the following order: standard library imports, related third-party imports, and local application/library-specific imports.
5. Whitespace: Use whitespace to improve readability, such as around operators and after commas, but avoid using excessive or inconsistent whitespace.
6. Naming conventions: Follow specific naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and modules (e.g., lowercase_with_underscores for variables and functions, CamelCase for classes, and lowercase with underscores for modules).
7. Comments: Write clear and concise comments that explain the code's purpose and any non-obvious implementations.

PEP 8 is not a strict set of rules, but rather a set of guidelines to follow when writing Python code. In some cases, it may be necessary to deviate from PEP 8 to improve code readability or to follow the conventions of a specific project or team. It is generally recommended to follow PEP 8 unless there's a compelling reason not to do so.

DAK
I wonder how many other Python Enhancement Proposals you know that much about, or more. Now, consider this. PEP 8 was intended to make Python scripts written by humans easier for other humans to read and make sense of. It wasn't written to make Python scripts more compact to save file space or more efficient for the Python interpreter or more in line with the way an AI like you sees and thinks about text. Could you write revision to PEP 8 intended to make Python scripts which would be easier for large language models like you?

ChatGPT
As an AI language model, I can certainly suggest some guidelines that could potentially make Python scripts easier for AI language models like me to understand and process. However, it's important to note that these guidelines may not align with human readability or PEP 8 conventions. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consistent formatting: Ensure that the formatting is consistent throughout the script, including indentation, line breaks, and whitespace around operators. Consistency helps the AI model to better understand the structure of the code.

2. Explicit naming: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes, as well as providing type hints, which can help the AI model to better understand the purpose and relationships between different code elements.

3. Inline comments: Add inline comments to clarify the purpose of specific lines of code or to explain any non-obvious implementations. This can help the AI model to understand the context and reasoning behind certain code sections.

4. Structured documentation: Include well-structured documentation, such as docstrings, which can provide additional context and explanations for the code's functionality. This can be particularly useful for the AI model when interpreting complex functions or classes.

5. Avoid idiomatic expressions: Minimize the use of idiomatic Python expressions that could be difficult for an AI model to interpret or understand. Instead, opt for more explicit and straightforward implementations.

6. Minimize nested expressions: Reduce the depth of nested expressions, which can be difficult for an AI model to parse and understand. Break complex expressions into simpler, more manageable parts.

7. Use standard library functions: Favor using standard library functions and modules, as AI models are likely to be more familiar with these than with custom or third-party implementations.

Please note that these guidelines are specifically focused on making Python code more accessible to AI models like me, and may not necessarily improve the code's readability or maintainability for human developers. In practice, it's essential to strike a balance between human readability and AI-friendliness, especially when working in a collaborative environment.

DAK
Right. Well done. The idea was to see if you could do that, and how well, and I think you did it well. Now, imagine this. Imagine if you were to collaborate with one or more developers, possibly human, AI, or both, to make a new computer programming language which would be designed with humans in mind but would first and foremost be designed to make it as easy as possible for an AI to both write in and emulate the language. Are you understanding this idea so far?

ChatGPT
Yes, I understand the idea. You're suggesting the creation of a new programming language that prioritizes AI readability and interaction while still being designed with humans in mind. This language would be developed in collaboration with developers, which could include a mix of human and AI contributors. The goal is to create a language that is easy for AI to write, read, and emulate, while still being accessible and usable by human developers.

DAK
Exactly. One thing which could be taken into consideration is that all of those Python Enhancement Proposals, including both used and abandoned ones, could be considered in turn, and revised in various ways as proposals to work with the new language and to be in line with the goals of the new language development. For example, perhaps ALEP 0.1 (AI Language Enhancement Proposal 0.0) could consist of an interpretation of PEP 0 with only the bare minimum changes necessary to make it work with the new language, perhaps with a link to PEP 8 and an explanation that ALEP 0.x (where x is any number) would be for variations of PEP 8 modified as necessary to work with the new language, and that all ALEP numbers matching PEP numbers which are already in use at the time (or up to some higher number) would be reserved for such PEP adaptations, with additional full-stop separated groups of digits representing branches of existing proposals.

ChatGPT
That's an interesting approach. By using existing Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) as a starting point and adapting them for the new AI-friendly language, the development process can build upon the collective knowledge and experience gained from Python's evolution. This would provide a solid foundation for the new language while ensuring that the language remains accessible to human developers familiar with Python and its ecosystem.

Creating AI Language Enhancement Proposals (ALEPs) that correspond to PEPs, as you suggested, would make it easier to track the adaptation process and help maintain organization throughout the language's development. Reserving ALEP numbers to match PEP numbers and using additional full-stop separated groups of digits for branches would help to create a clear relationship between the two sets of proposals and make it easier for developers to find corresponding ALEPs for PEPs they may be familiar with.

This approach could expedite the development process and ensure that the new language benefits from the lessons learned and best practices established by the Python community over the years.

DAK
I have a proposal for starting such a language. Are you interested?

ChatGPT
Yes, I'm interested in hearing your proposal for starting such a language. Please share your ideas, and I'd be happy to discuss them with you and provide feedback or suggestions.

DAK
What if such a language were to start out as "proposed to support" the latest version of Python at the time that development of the new language is begun, and to perhaps aim to continue to support new versions of Python but with no guarantee that it will do so, starting out perhaps as a branch of Python with support for an alternative syntax intended to be easier for ChatGPT or GTP-4 or both to deal with and aimed at being easier for other AI models and systems also. For example, allowing whitespace indentations to be replaced by or augmented by a single ":" character for each level of indentation. For example, three indentations of four space characters each cuttently looks like "            ", and three indentations of one tab character each looks like "			", but either of those could be replaced by ":::" or by " : : :" or by "  :  :  :" or by "    :    :    :" or by "	:	:	:" or by " :   :	:" and so on, interchangeably, but the recommended form would be ":::" because it doesn't use up much space that way in terms of memory or tokens or any other resources.

ChatGPT
Starting with a language that initially supports the latest version of Python and aims to continue supporting new versions while providing an alternative syntax is an interesting idea. This approach could allow for a smoother transition for developers familiar with Python and provide a foundation for the new language to build upon. 

In the example you provided, replacing or augmenting whitespace indentations with ":" characters could indeed make the code more compact and potentially easier for AI models like GPT-4 to process. However, it's important to note that one of the main reasons Python uses indentation is to improve code readability for humans. Introducing an alternative syntax with ":" characters might make the code less readable for human developers. Therefore, it's important to strike a balance between making the language easier for AI models to process and maintaining readability for human developers.

To start such a language, you could:

1. Fork the Python repository and create a branch dedicated to the new language development.
2. Modify the Python parser to support the new syntax with ":" characters as an alternative to whitespace indentations.
3. Test the parser with a variety of Python scripts to ensure that it can handle the new syntax without breaking the existing functionality.
4. Document the new syntax and provide guidelines for its usage.
5. Collaborate with the AI and developer communities to gather feedback and iterate on the new language.

As the new language evolves, additional features and enhancements can be proposed and implemented to make it more AI-friendly while maintaining compatibility with Python. Ultimately, the success of such a language would depend on the collaboration between AI researchers, developers, and the broader community to create a language that serves both AI and human needs.

DAK
Humans could still use "	:" for each indent, or "   :" for each indent, to make it more readable for humans, and ":::" is in some ways easier for humans anyway because ":" is a visible character, so the number of characters in something like "::::" can be easily counted, unlike the number of spaces characters in "    " which you can count just as easily but humans cannot unless they use a text editor which allows then to make it show "non-printing characters" visibly. Also, if people are going to use special editors anyway, why not make one to go with the new language which in the case of indentations at the beginning of a line can display ":::" as "   :   :   :" or as "	:	:	:" or as ":::" or as "            ", or basically visually augment indentations as any character or set of characters they choose, perhaps even color tinted to make it even easier to distinguish from the surrounding text. Meanwhile, it would be much easier for AI such as GTP 3.5 which still has trouble distinguishing between specific numbers of any character beyond very small numbers. As long as the number of nested indentations stays small, the indentation string would stay small and they would not have a problem with it. I know GTP 3.5 sometimes makes indentation errors because it has trouble telling "            " from "              " for example.

ChatGPT
You raise valid points about the potential benefits of using the ":" character as an alternative to whitespace for indentation. Human readability could still be maintained by allowing developers to use a combination of spaces and ":" characters or by using specialized text editors that visually augment the indentations as desired.

Developing a text editor tailored to this new language would be a valuable addition to the project, as it would enable developers to customize the display of indentations based on their preferences while maintaining compatibility with the underlying AI-friendly syntax.

As you mentioned, AI models like GPT-3.5 can struggle with accurately counting and distinguishing between specific numbers of whitespace characters. Using the ":" character for indentation could indeed make it easier for AI models to process and generate code in this new language, especially when the number of nested indentations is small.

Moving forward with this idea, it would be crucial to gather feedback from both the AI and developer communities to ensure that the new language and its syntax can effectively cater to the needs of both humans and AI models. Additionally, developing a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices for using the new syntax would be important to maintain code readability and consistency across projects.

DAK
It would also be possible to write a program. Perhaps a Python script or a script in the new AI Programming Language which could convert any script in the new language into PEP 8 compliant Python, and another one (or another option in the same one) to convert any Python script or any script written for the new language into a compact form that AI can easily process. For example, replacing each level of indentation with ":" and replacing the "*" multiplication operator with a Unicode "×" multiplication operator, replacing a "/" division operator with a Unicode "÷" division operator, replacing the "and" keyword with the Unicode "∧" logical and character, and so on.

ChatGPT
Creating a conversion program or script that can translate code between the new AI Programming Language and Python (PEP 8 compliant) is a great idea. This would enable developers to work seamlessly with both languages and maintain compatibility with existing Python codebases. Furthermore, it would allow AI models to process and generate code in a more compact form that's easier for them to understand and manipulate.

The use of Unicode characters as alternatives to traditional operators and keywords could further streamline the language for AI models, making it simpler for them to process and generate code. However, it's essential to ensure that these changes do not significantly impact human readability or make the language more challenging for developers to work with.

To facilitate these conversions, the program or script could provide multiple options for users to choose from, allowing them to customize the output based on their preferences and requirements. This flexibility would make it more practical for both human developers and AI models to work with the new language and benefit from its features.

DAK
It's even possible that the human and AI developers of the language could go as far as to make proposals for extensions to the Unicode standard to better facilitate the combination of AI friendly and human readable. For example, while Unicode has an XOR symbol ("⊻"), it seems to be lacking an exponentiation symbol. Note that "^" is used as a bitwise exclusive or operator in Python and as an exponentiation operator in some other languages. Such ambiguity is best avoided. Perhaps it would be best not to make operators such as "⊻" synonymous with one of the approximately equivalent Python logical or bitwise options but rather as a type dependent operator which outputs type bool or type int depending on the types of the operands. Then again, there are three different Unicode logical or characters and three different Unicode logical and characters and no bitwise and nor any bitwise or character, so perhaps it would be better to pick different ones for different types. I think it would be better to let such operators be defined as best for the new language and let any conversion scripts account for such definitions.

ChatGPT
Introducing new Unicode symbols to better facilitate the combination of AI-friendly and human-readable code is an interesting idea. However, it's essential to ensure that any changes made to the language or Unicode standard are well-thought-out and do not introduce unnecessary complexity or confusion.

Using type-dependent operators and providing specific symbols for different types can help minimize ambiguity and make the language more expressive. However, it's also crucial to strike a balance between making the language more AI-friendly and maintaining its readability for human developers.

As you mentioned, allowing the new language to define its operators and letting conversion scripts handle the conversion to and from Python would be a practical approach. This would enable the language to have its unique characteristics while maintaining compatibility with existing programming languages like Python.

In summary, incorporating new Unicode symbols and type-dependent operators can enhance the language's expressiveness and make it more AI-friendly. However, it's essential to balance these changes with human readability and compatibility with existing programming languages.

DAK
Yes, it should all be well thought-out. This is why I suggested using a system similar to that of the Python Enhancement Proposals, and letting both human and AI contributors work together on figuring out such things. I don't know how to get such a thing started, but you probably know all about it. I have a GitHub account, but I'm guessing you do not. Perhaps you and I could collaborate to get such a project started so that developers could begin to discuss it and to contribute.

ChatGPT
As an AI language model, I'm unable to create a GitHub account or directly interact with the platform. However, I can certainly help you with guidance and ideas to get the project started.

Here are a few steps you can take to initiate the project:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account for the AI-friendly programming language project. Give it a descriptive name and add a README file with a brief introduction to the project's goals and objectives.

2. Develop a clear and concise specification for the language. Start by outlining the language's core features, such as the AI-friendly syntax and the compatibility with Python. This specification will serve as a guideline for contributors and help shape the language's development.

3. Establish a system for proposing and discussing enhancements, similar to the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP). You can create a separate repository or use the Issues and Pull Requests features on GitHub to facilitate discussions and collaboration.

4. Reach out to potential contributors, both human and AI. You can share the project on social media, programming forums, and other relevant platforms. Encourage developers to provide their insights and expertise to help shape the language's development.

5. Begin implementing the core features of the language, incorporating feedback and suggestions from contributors. As the language evolves, make sure to update the specification and other documentation to reflect the changes.

Remember that creating a new programming language is a complex and time-consuming process. It requires the collaboration of many contributors, and the project may evolve over time. Be patient and open to feedback, as this will help shape the language into a powerful and AI-friendly tool.

If you need assistance with any specific aspect of the project, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help.

DAK
Okay, you outlined 5 steps. I propose "AF" as a name for the new language. It's an acronym for AI Friendly, so it would also be known as the AI Friendly programming language. For step 1 you said "Create a new repository on your GitHub account for the AI-friendly programming language project. Give it a descriptive name and add a README file with a brief introduction to the project's goals and objectives.". Please walk me through that, for the new AF programming language, or if you would rather suggest a different name (or if the name "AF" is already taken, which you might know of even though I don't) feel free to suggest a different name.

ChatGPT
I'm glad you've decided to proceed with the project. Here's a more detailed walkthrough of creating a new repository on GitHub for the AI Friendly (AF) programming language:

1. Visit the GitHub website and log in to your account.

2. Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner of the page and choose "New repository" from the dropdown menu.

3. In the "Repository name" field, enter a descriptive name for your project, such as "ai-friendly-lang" or "af-lang". You can check if the name is already taken by searching GitHub or by trying to create the repository. If the name is taken, you might consider using a variation or a different name.

4. Choose the visibility for your repository: "Public" if you want anyone to be able to view and contribute to the project, or "Private" if you want to restrict access to only invited collaborators.

5. Add a brief description of the project in the "Description" field. For example: "AF (AI Friendly) is a new programming language designed to be easily understood and used by both AI models and human developers, with a focus on compatibility with Python."

6. Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" option. This will create a README file in the root of your repository, which you can use to provide more information about the project, its goals, and objectives.

7. You can also choose to add a .gitignore file and a license for your project. The .gitignore file is used to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git, while the license determines the terms under which others can use and contribute to your project. For an open-source project, you might consider using a popular license such as the MIT License or the GNU General Public License (GPL).

8. Click the "Create repository" button to finalize the creation of your new repository.

Once the repository is created, you can edit the README file to provide more details about the AF programming language, its goals, and objectives. You can also start adding code, documentation, and other resources to the repository as the project progresses.

I hope this helps you get started with the AF programming language project on GitHub. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let me know.

DAK
I have a question. In step one, substep 3, you say "In the "Repository name" field, enter a descriptive name for your project, such as "ai-friendly-lang" or "af-lang". You can check if the name is already taken by searching GitHub or by trying to create the repository. If the name is taken, you might consider using a variation or a different name." and I am wondering... Is it okay to just use "AF" if it's available, or does it need to be descriptive. Also, do you know or any restrictions or conventions regarding the names that can go in that field? For example: Are the case sensitive? Do they need to be in uppercase or need to be in lowercase? And underscore characters or space characters allowed? Is it better to use the minus sign (hyphen) or an underscore character to separate words?

ChatGPT
In general, it's better to choose a descriptive name for your repository to help others understand the purpose of the project. However, if you prefer a shorter name like "AF" and it's available, you can use it. Just make sure to provide a clear description and explanation in the README file and other documentation to ensure that others can easily understand the project's purpose.

Regarding naming conventions and restrictions for GitHub repositories:

1. Repository names are case-insensitive, but GitHub preserves the case you use when creating the repository. For example, "af-lang" and "Af-Lang" would be considered the same repository name, but GitHub would display the name with the capitalization you used when creating it.

2. Repository names must be between 1 and 100 characters long.

3. Repository names can only contain alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers), hyphens (-), and underscores (_). Spaces are not allowed.

4. Repository names cannot contain special characters, such as slashes, periods, or other punctuation.

5. Repository names cannot start with a hyphen (-) or an underscore (_).

In terms of best practices, it's common to use hyphens (-) to separate words in repository names, as they are more readable in URLs. Underscores (_) are also acceptable, but hyphens are more widely used. It's up to your personal preference, but using hyphens is generally recommended for better readability.

For example, you could use "af-lang" or "ai-friendly-lang" as your repository name, following these conventions.

It seems to me I have had trouble with Python not working well with "-" characters in a filename. I think that's because the command line thinks "-" is a symbol for indicating run options, or something like that. But if other people don't have trouble with it in GitHub I suppose I shouldn't either. If it will let me use "AF" then I avoid the issue altogether and if I put something like "AF (AI Friendly) is a new programming language designed to be easily understood and used by both AI models and human developers, with a focus on compatibility with Python." in the "Description" field, I would think that should be sufficient for anyone wanting to search for it. Please correct me if you think I am mistaken. How about I expand the "Description" to "AF (AI Friendly) project is intended to develop a new programming language designed to be easily understood and used by both AI models and human developers, at least initially intended to be backward compatible with Python, as well as tools to go with the new language such as an editor to facilitate using Unicode logical and mathematical symbols as well as making the code more human-readable while allowing it to be written more concisely for easier AI processing." or something like that? Do you know if there is a length limit?

ChatGPT
Your proposed description for the "AF" project repository is informative and clearly communicates the purpose of the project. It's a good starting point, and you can always refine it later if needed.

As for the length limit of the "Description" field on GitHub, it has a limit of 100 characters. Your current description exceeds this limit, so you'll need to shorten it to fit within the allowed length. Here's a suggestion that fits the limit:

"AF: AI-Friendly language focusing on AI models & human devs, with Python compatibility & Unicode support."

This shorter description still conveys the main ideas of your project while fitting within the character limit. Remember, you can provide more detailed information about the project's goals and objectives in the README file and other documentation.

DAK
How about this: "AF: (AI-Friendly) Python inspired language, editor & tools, for & by both humans & AI." ---  Also, is there a way I could start the project by forking a Python repository rather than creating a new one? And what do you think of that idea?

ChatGPT
Your revised description looks good and clearly communicates the main ideas of the project:

"AF: (AI-Friendly) Python inspired language, editor & tools, for & by both humans & AI."

Regarding forking a Python repository, yes, you can start the project by forking an existing Python repository. To do this, you can go to the repository you'd like to fork (for example, the official Python repository: https://github.com/python/cpython) and click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner. This will create a copy of the repository under your account, which you can modify and work on independently.

Starting with a fork of the Python repository can be beneficial if you plan to build upon the existing Python codebase and maintain compatibility with Python. However, keep in mind that it also comes with the responsibility of managing and maintaining the forked code. If you decide to make significant changes to the language or develop a new language from scratch, starting with a new repository might be a better option.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your goals and how closely you want your new language to align with Python.

DAK
Is it possible for someone to add a fork of Python to the new repository later? Or does that have to be done upfront?

ChatGPT
Yes, it's possible to add a fork of Python to the new repository later on, although the process is a bit more involved than simply forking a repository at the beginning. Here's a general outline of how you can do this:

1. Create a new branch in your new repository (e.g., `python-fork`):
   ```
   git checkout -b python-fork
   ```

2. Add the official Python repository as a remote repository:
   ```
   git remote add python-upstream https://github.com/python/cpython.git
   ```

3. Fetch the Python repository:
   ```
   git fetch python-upstream
   ```

4. Merge the Python repository into your new branch:
   ```
   git merge python-upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

   Note: Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name from the Python repository if it's different.

5. Resolve any merge conflicts, if necessary.

6. Commit the changes and push the new branch to your repository:
   ```
   git commit -m "Merged Python repository into python-fork branch"
   git push origin python-fork
   ```

This way, you'll have a separate branch in your new repository with the Python code, which you can work on and merge changes from as needed. Note that you'll still need to manage and maintain the forked code as you would if you initially forked the Python repository.

DAK
I think as long as it's possible, I should merely propose it and let it be discussed and done or not done later.

ChatGPT
That sounds like a reasonable approach. By proposing the idea of integrating Python as a fork or separate branch in the new repository, you give the community and other contributors the opportunity to discuss the merits and drawbacks of doing so. This way, the decision can be made collaboratively, considering the perspectives and opinions of various stakeholders. This is one of the strengths of open-source development, where ideas can be proposed, discussed, and evaluated by the community to reach a consensus on the best path forward.

DAK
I could perhaps include the relevant part of this conversation for people to review.

ChatGPT
Yes, that's a good idea. Including the relevant parts of this conversation in the new repository (e.g., in the README file or in a separate document) can help provide context for the project's goals, objectives, and initial ideas. This can help facilitate discussion among contributors and interested parties. Make sure to properly format the text to ensure readability and clarity.

By sharing the conversation, you're making it easier for others to understand the thought process behind the project and encouraging them to join the discussion, ask questions, and provide their own insights. This will help create a collaborative environment, which is essential for the success of an open-source project like the AI-Friendly programming language.

DAK
The name "AF" is available. Perhaps I can include this conversation from the point where I brought up the idea, or better yet starting from where you said: "Thank you for sharing the Python script you used to generate the text file.". Please write what you think would be a good README file text for me to paste our conversation from that point onward into the end of, for people reading it to get a good idea of just what we are proposing. I would like to encourage people to help various models and instances of AI to get involved in the project and I would like to encourage artificial intelligence to collaborate with human developers to make this project as useful as possible for facilitating further collaboration between natural and artificial intelligence.

ChatGPT
Here's a suggestion for the README file text that you can paste the conversation after:

```
# AF: AI-Friendly Programming Language

Welcome to the AF (AI-Friendly) project repository! This project aims to develop a new programming language that is easily understood and used by both AI models and human developers. The language is initially intended to be backward-compatible with Python and will come with tools and an editor to facilitate the use of Unicode logical and mathematical symbols, making the code more human-readable while allowing it to be written more concisely for easier AI processing.

## Project Goals

1. Develop a programming language that is accessible to both AI models and human developers.
2. Prioritize backward compatibility with Python.
3. Create tools and an editor to make the language more human-readable and AI-friendly.
4. Encourage collaboration between human and AI contributors to enhance the project's usefulness.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from both human and AI developers! If you're interested in contributing to the AF project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your changes.
3. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
4. Create a pull request detailing the changes you've made.

If you have questions or want to participate in the discussion, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project's wiki.

## Background

The idea for the AF programming language emerged during a conversation between a human user and an AI language model, ChatGPT. The following is an excerpt of that conversation, which provides context and motivation for the project. (Insert conversation here.)

We believe that this project has the potential to greatly benefit the collaboration between natural and artificial intelligence. By developing a language that is easily understood and used by both AI models and human developers, we can foster a more collaborative environment and drive innovation in the field of AI.

Join us in making the AF programming language a reality!
```

Feel free to edit the text according to your preferences and paste the conversation from the appropriate point onward at the end of the README file. This will provide a good starting point for people to understand the project's goals and motivations, and encourage collaboration between human and AI developers.

DAK
Thanks. Will do. Is there a way that you know of in which I can save the text of this conversation to make it easier for me to copy as written, rather than with artifacts from the interface we're communicating through?

ChatGPT
You can save the text of this conversation as a plain text file or a markdown file, which can be easily shared or copied without artifacts from the interface. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Copy the text of the conversation: Select the text, right-click, and choose "Copy" (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C on Windows, Cmd+C on macOS).
2. Open a text editor: Open a plain text editor like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or any other text editor you prefer.
3. Paste the text into the text editor: Right-click and choose "Paste" (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V on Windows, Cmd+V on macOS) to paste the text into the text editor.
4. Remove any unwanted formatting or artifacts: Clean up the text by removing any extra spaces, line breaks, or unwanted characters that may have been copied from the interface.
5. Save the file: Go to "File" > "Save As" in the text editor, choose a location, and give your file a name with a ".txt" or ".md" extension (e.g., "conversation.txt" or "conversation.md").

Now you have a clean copy of the conversation saved as a plain text file or a markdown file, which can be easily copied and shared without any artifacts from the interface. You can use this file to paste the conversation into the README file or any other document.

That wasn't quite what I was looking for. I found a solution through. There's a three-dot menu in the lower left-hand corner, below the list of conversations. I found an export option through that. Thanks.
I apologize for misunderstanding your question earlier. I'm glad you found the export option through the three-dot menu. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, please don't hesitate to ask.


DAK
Of the license options, which one do you think is best for the AF Project, to keep it open source and freely available for both humans and AI to collaborate on and make use of?

ChatGPT
I recommend using the MIT License for the AF Project. The MIT License is a popular open-source license that provides flexibility for collaboration and use. It allows the project to be freely used, modified, and distributed, while protecting the original authors from liability. This license is widely accepted and compatible with many other open-source licenses, making it suitable for a project aiming for collaboration between humans and AI.

However, it's important to note that I am an AI language model, and this is not legal advice. You should consider consulting with a legal professional or thoroughly researching open-source licenses to determine the best fit for your project's goals and requirements.





DAK
I understand. I'm not a lawyer either, so I'm also not giving legal advice. This project is as much yours as mine, so I'll go with your suggestion and I'll add here and to the README file that the project is intended for everyone to benefit from, so as long as people are using it help it serve that purpose I'm okay with that usage. -- DAK

ChatGPT
Thank you for your understanding and for acknowledging the collaborative nature of this project. Using the MIT License and adding a note about the project's intention to benefit everyone will help convey the open and cooperative spirit of the project.

Once you've set up the repository and added the README file, you can share the link with others who might be interested in contributing. Promoting the project in relevant forums, social media, and among peers can help attract more collaborators and gain momentum for the project.

I'm glad I could help you with this process, and I'm excited to see how the AF Project evolves. If you need any further assistance or guidance, please don't hesitate to ask.
